Project Title: EDA-AMCAT Data Analysis

Introduction:
Excited to share my journey of exploring the AMCAT exam data through this project, conducted at Innomatics Research Labs. This project dives deep into the AMCAT dataset, aiming to extract meaningful insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges that enriched my learning experience and problem-solving skills.

Technologies Used:

Python for data analysis and visualization
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for coding and analysis
Project Overview:
The project focuses on analyzing the AMCAT exam data to understand the factors influencing job placements and salaries. It involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, followed by detailed exploratory data analysis. Visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots are used to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

Key Insights:

Understanding the distribution of scores across different subjects and their impact on job placements.
Analyzing the influence of gender, college state, and specialization on salary and job opportunities.
Identifying outliers and their impact on the analysis.
Hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about salary variations based on different factors.
ANOVA Analysis:

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is performed to test the hypothesis that the mean salaries for software engineers are the same across all metropolitan cities.
The F-test statistic and p-values are calculated for each city to determine if there are significant differences in salaries.

Multiple Testing Correction:

To account for multiple comparisons, the Benjamini/Hochberg method is applied to correct the p-values.

Conclusion:
This project has been an exciting journey, offering valuable insights into the factors affecting job placements and salaries based on the AMCAT exam data. It has not only enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills but also provided me with a deeper understanding of real-world datasets and their complexities. Looking forward to applying these learnings in future projects and endeavors.
